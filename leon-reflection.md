* The Git concepts I was struggling with prior to GPS session was understanding Fetch and Merge Release 4. I looked up many examples and after the session I realized that Fetch and Merge is a pull broken up into two steps.

* Fetch and Merge was greatly simplified to me on this session as well as the Merge conflict that myself and my pair needed to go back and work on.

* Some questions that came up for me for both my pair and our guided instructor was some commands for terminal. There are a few similar commands and I wanted to know which oneâ€™s were the most convenient. 

* I need to review how to go backwards when I do make a mistake. For example we went over merge conflicts and did not repeat the same change to receive error message. Is this something we need to start over or can we go forward from where we began.

* This GPS experience went well and revieced great insight on things to look forward to and resources to reach out to incase we need to go through it again.
